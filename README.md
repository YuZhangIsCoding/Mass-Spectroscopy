# Mass-Spectroscopy
Data analysis for Mass Spectroscopy

For each compound, we conducted mass spectroscopy 20 times. Some of the peaks appeared in both compounds, while some only in one and not in the other. For those common peaks, we first did independent two-sample T test to distinguish whether the change between R and S is due to experimental errors. In addition, peaks that only appear in one compound were also listed.
